# Creating an Account

To start using Thundra, you first need to create a Thundra account. This is a very easy and straightforward process.

* To start, open [console.thundra.io](https://console.thundra.io/landing).
* Click Sign Up tab if you don't have an account.
* Enter your email address, password, and your name.
* That's it! Now you have a Thundra account.

After you create your account, you will answer questions about your company name and your role in your company so we can get to know you better.

Now you are ready to monitor your functions in Thundra. To do that, you have two options:

* Monitor and secure your applications in different ways.
  * Connect Thundra to your CloudWatch logs in order to get your functions from AWS. You can learn how to connect Thundra [here](connect-thundra.md).
  * Instrument your functions one by one, as discussed [here](instrument-to-achieve-deeper-level-of-visibility.md).
* Debug your functions on your own environment using Thundra. For more details, click [here](thundra-debugger.md).
