# AWS SAM

When you use AWS SAM to deploy your functions, you can add Thundra to your project with minimal effort. The steps for AWS SAM installation are:

1. Add Thundra Layer to the application.
2. Change the handler to the Thundra handler so that it can trace your function.
3. Tell Thundra where to initiate your logic (point it back to your original handler).

You can find detailed information about how to do this on our [Node.js](../node.js/nodejs-integration-options.md), [Python](../python/integration-options.md), [Java](../java/integration-options/), and [.NET ](../.net/integration-options.md)in the integration documentation. &#x20;
