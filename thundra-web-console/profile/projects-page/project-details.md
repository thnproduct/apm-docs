# Project Details



![Project Details Page Breakdown](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Project dEtails.png>)

The Project Details page allows you to see an overview of how actively you are using a specific project, including statistics that add to your cost, and shows you detailed usage statistics throughout the existence of the project. Moreover, it also allows you to set usage limits for the project, including Request Count.

You can access this page by clicking on the Projects icon in Thundra's navigation bar (located on the left side of the console), which will take you to the Projects page. You will then see a list of your Thundra Projects. When you selecta project, you will be directed to the Project Details page, where you can find all relevant information for the project.

There are four components in the Project Details page, which include:

* Project Profile
* Total Request Count Graph
* Total Data Usage Graph
* Limit Control

### Project Profile



![Project Profile Breakdown](<../../../.gitbook/assets/project profile.png>)

The Project Profile provides the overall information of a specific project, including:

* Project Name - Name of the Thundra Project.
* Project Filter - Option to see only the Lambda functions associated with the Project in the [Functions List](../../functions-list-page/).
* Project Description - Description of the Thundra Project that you entered when you created the project.
* Project Stats - The accumulative Request Count and Data Usage of the Lambda functions associated with the project via the project’s API key.

### Total Request Count graph

This graph provides the cumulative requests made by the Lambda functions associated with the project based on time intervals. This allows you to see how the Thundra Project has been used since its creation.

### Total Data Usage Graph

This graph provides the cumulative data usage of the Lambda functions associated with the project based on time intervals. This allows you to see how the Thundra Project has been used since its creation.

### Limit Control

As mentioned in the Managing Projects section, whenever you create a project, it is entitled to all the resources assigned to your account based on your subscription plan. However, you can set a limit to the Request Count quota of your specific Thundra Project using the Limit Control setting. By default, this option is set to “Unlimited.” However, by clicking on the “Set Your Own Limit” option, you can set the “Request Count”.
