# Organizations Page

The Organizations page lists details of the organizations that your account belongs to.

You can navigate to the Organizations page by hovering mouse on the Profile button located on the left-hand side bar of the Thundra console and clicking the "Organizations" item.

{% hint style="info" %}
A user can be a member of more than one organization or different accounts by invitation from another user or by creating new accounts, in which you will automatically become the `Account Owner`.
{% endhint %}

When you open the Organizations page, you can display your organizations in terms of:

* Organization Name
* My Role
* Actions - Displays your current organization
