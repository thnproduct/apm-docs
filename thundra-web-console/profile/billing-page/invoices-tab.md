The Invoices tab displays all of your billing records and provides you with a download link so that you can save a hard copy of an invoice. Invoice details are displayed in four different columns:

* Date - The date that the invoice was generated.
* Unit and Price - A description of what you purchased and the amount you were charged.
* Subtotal - The price charged for a specific item.
* Download Invoice - The option to download a PDF copy of the invoice.

You can navigate to the Invoices tab by opening the user profile selection. Next, navigate to the Billing page, and then select the Invoices tab.
