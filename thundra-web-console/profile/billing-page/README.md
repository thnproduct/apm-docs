# Billing Page

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

The Billing page allows you to manage your Thundra subscription, see your invoices, and view detailed information of your overall Thundra usage, allowing you to gauge whether or not your current subscription is sufficient for your monitoring needs. All this information is split across three tab views:

* Subscription
* Invoices
* Report

You can access the Billing page by clicking on the Profile icon located at the bottom of Thundraâ€™s navigation bar, which sits on the left-hand side of the Thundra console.
