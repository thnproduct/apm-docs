In Thundra, you can create an alert policy that will help you stay aware of issues in your serverless architecture. When setting alerts, you can select different ways to receive notifications, including having them sent to your PagerDuty app. To have your notifications sent to PagerDuty, you need to enter your settings in this PagerDuty tab.

Making a PagerDuty configuration is very easy and straightforward. You can copy and paste the PagerDuty API key in this tab, and then save it. Now you can display your API key when [creating an alert](../../../alerts-page/creating-editing-alert-policies.md).

If you want to remove your integration, just click on the “Remove” button. However, if you have alert policies set up with a PagerDuty notification, you cannot delete this API key.

To navigate PagerDuty tab, firstly click on User icon and Settings item then open PagerDuty Tab.
