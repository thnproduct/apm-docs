# Debugger Tab

{% hint style="warning" %}
Thundra Debugger is separated from Thundra APM and is now called Serverless Debugger. You can find related info here: [https://www.serverlessdebugger.com/](https://www.serverlessdebugger.com/)\


If you are looking for a debugger within Thundra APM then check out\
[merloc-debug-and-hot-reload-for-lambdas](../../../debugging/merloc-debug-and-hot-reload-for-lambdas/ "mention").
{% endhint %}

The Thundra Debugger enables you to have an online, native debugging experience for your Lambda functions in serverless applications via real-time data on your IDE. We don't simulate any resources or mock any data. To enable the Thundra Debugger, navigate to the Debugger tab, where you can receive your authentication key and start to debug your Lambda functions.
