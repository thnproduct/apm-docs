# VictorOps Tab

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (52).png>)

In Thundra, you can create an alert policy that will help you stay aware of issues in your serverless architecture. When setting alerts, you can select different ways to receive notifications, including having them sent to your VictorOps app. To have your notifications sent to VictorOps, you need to set up your settings in the VictorOps tab.

Making a VictorOps configuration is very easy and straightforward. You can copy and paste the VictorOps integration URL in this tab, and then save it. Now you can display your URL when [creating an alert](../../../alerts-page/creating-editing-alert-policies.md).

If you want to remove your integration, just click on the “Remove” button. However, if you have alert policies set up with a VictorOps notification, you cannot delete this URL.

To navigate to the VictorOps tab, just click on the User icon and Settings item and go to Alert Integrations tab. Then you will be able to open the VictorOps tab.
