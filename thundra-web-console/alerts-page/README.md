# Alerts Page

The Alerts page allows you to manage your existing alert policies and view the events that violate these policies.

YoÄ±u can navigate to the Alerts page by clicking the alert icon button located on the left-hand sidebar. The number displayed on this icon represents the number of alert policies which have active events at that moment.
