# Applications Detail Page

The Application Details page provides detailed and insightful monitoring data for your application, and even allows you to navigate through monitoring data of specific requests. The details for a specific application can be viewed when you click on an application in the [Applications Page](../applications-page.md).&#x20;

This page has two main sections. The top section displays function stats and overall metrics within a selected time range. The second part of the page displays detailed monitoring data, which is split into two tab views.

The Application Details page has two main components that allow you to navigate through the details of your selected application. These components are:

* Application Profile
* Application Data Tabs

### Application Data Tabs

This section provides application data that is collected by Thundra. Metrics and overall requests of the application are provided in this section with the following two tabs:

* Overview - The overview tab gives two different insights about your application. When the page first loads, an overview of the application is displayed. If any endpoint is selected from this tab, the endpointâ€™s metrics will be displayed.
* Transactions - This tab lists the transactions of the application and allows you to filter and order them.
