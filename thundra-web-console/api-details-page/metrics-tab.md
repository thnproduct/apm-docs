# General API Metrics Tab

The Metrics tab gives you an overall picture of an API’s performance metrics. Three different metrics are displayed under this tab: Request Counts, Request Durations, and Error Counts. These metrics give you insight into the health of requests linked to the selected API.

### Request Counts

This allows you to easily display how the Request Count changed for an API within a selected time range.

### Request Durations

Using the Request Durations chart, you have an insight into how durations of an API’s requests change by time. You can display three different duration metrics:

* Average
* P90
* P99

To read duration for a specific time, you simply need to hover your mouse over the chart.

### Error Counts

The Error Counts chart shows you the number of 4xx and 5xx responded requests within a selected time range.

To read error counts for a specific time, you simply need to hover your mouse over the chart.
