# Endpoints Tab

An endpoint is a way of connecting to your APIs, and Thundra helps you to  discover which endpoints are connected to a specific API through the Endpoints tab.

This tab allows you to display the overall throughput for an endpoint. Metrics such as durations, requests, and error counts can be displayed here and understood with just a quick glance.

When an endpoint is called, it will be listed under this tab in terms of:

* Endpoint Name - Name of the endpoint.
* Request Count - Total request count within the selected time period for a specific endpoint of an API.
* Error Count - Total erroneous request count within the selected time period for a specific endpoint of an API.
* Average Duration - Average duration of the requests of the endpoint within the selected time period.
* P90 Duration - P90 duration of the requests of the endpoint within the selected time period.
* P99 Duration - P99 duration of the requests of the endpoint within the selected time period.

To display the requests of a specific endpoint, click on its respective row. You will be redirected to the [Requests Tab](requests-tab.md) with the endpoint filter.
